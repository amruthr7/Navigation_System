A 'Navigation system' for self-driving vehicles (Application developed using C++)

This project provides data structure for the navigation of self driving car whose reference is supplied by a GPS sensor. This project :
- Allows to store multiple desired start and end locations in a way-point database format, acceptable by the path-planning module.
- Stores multiple 'Point of Interests' that can be imported from google maps.
- Allows route structure that links all the 'point of interests' between any two given waypoints.
